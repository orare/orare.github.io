### A mod for Risk of Rain 2 that adds new items.

This mod adds a small collection of new items into Risk of Rain 2. Currently it adds the *Lucky Default Sphere* which adds the chance to roll shrines an additonal time at no cost. It also includes the *Lucky Default Cube* which gives the chance when picking up an item to give an additonal copy of that item.

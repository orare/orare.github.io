### A save editor for the game Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem

This is a fully fledged save game editor for the game Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem. Written in C# by Robert Woemmel and myself. It supports editing of nearly all characters stats, the ability to unlock skills, cosmetics, and city upgrades. It also allows you to create brand new items from scratch as well as edit existing ones. It even allows you to import builds from third party sites such as [Wolcen-Universe](https://wolcen-universe.com/).

        <div id="content-body"><p>Hi there, my name’s Kyle and I’m currently looking for work as a software developer. I’ve been tinkering with computers for nearly 20 years now and I love playing around with both hardware and software.</p>

<p>I got my start as a kid creating mods for my favorite video games and quickly realized how much fun can be had just creating cool things with nothing but your imagination and some code.</p>

<p>My go to languages currently are C# and Python but I’ve used Java, PHP, Javascript/Typescript, among others various languages thoughout my time working with software. I’m set to graduate from Tulsa Community College in December of 2026 with my degree being AAS IT: Application Development</p>

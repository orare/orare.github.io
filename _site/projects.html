        <h3 id="a-build-optimizer-for-league-of-legends">A build optimizer for League of Legends</h3>

<p>LoLMath.net is a site for generating ‘optimal’ builds for league champions.</p>

<p>Originally created by ‘Inverted Composer’ and since picked up by ‘M’ and a bunch of other really cool guys over on their discord.
It’s not open sourced but if want to contribute or you’re just curious then asking in the discord is usually enough to get you access to the codebase. It’s built with react and uses typescript for the everything pretty much.</p>

<p>There are a <strong>ton</strong> of options to tweak to fit your playstyle and preferences. Builds take into account all sorts of stuff such as enemy composition, expected incoming damage, enemy defenses, runes, combat scenarios, dragon buffs, item proficiencies and a ton of other stuff. If you don’t like the way a build looks than you can adjust your settings to better suit how you like to build. Some builds may seem strange but I encourge you to give them a try. These builds do work even in high elo (challenger &amp; masters). The original dev “Inverted Composer” was a challenger player and quite a few of the other devs are masters and high diamonds players.</p>

<p>It’s a super cool project overall and is a lot of fun to work on.</p>

Hi there, my name's Kyle and I'm currently looking for work as a software developer. I've been tinkering with computers for nearly 20 years now and I love playing around with both hardware and software.

 I got my start as a kid creating mods for my favorite video games and quickly realized how much fun can be had just creating cool things with nothing but your imagination and some code.

My go to languages currently are C# and Python but I've used Java, PHP, Javascript/Typescript, among others various languages thoughout my time working with software. I'm set to graduate from Tulsa Community College in December of 2026 with my degree being AAS IT: Application Development
